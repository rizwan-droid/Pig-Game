## Events and Events handling rolling the dice

Events = Notifications that are sent to notify the code that something happened on the webpage.
examples: clicking a button, resizing a window, scrolling down or pressing key.

Event Listener = A function that performs an action based on a creation event. it waits a specific event to happen.

## How events are processed.
Execution stack : multiple execution context with 1 global context beside this it have another thing that is message queue which collects all the events like scroll, click execution

-when all the execution context returns and the execution stack gets empty then event from message queue comes in the frame and due to event listener it gets performed.

Note: Event listener is a function thats why it makes another execution context in the stack.

callback function: A function that is passed in another functions arguments and called by another function is called callback function.

state variable: state variable tells the condition of the system. it is used when we need something or remember something i.e true or false.
